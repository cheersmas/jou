# or
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow Go conventions and best practices
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused

### Project Structure

- Follow the existing clean architecture pattern
- Keep domain logic separate from UI logic
- Use interfaces for dependency injection
- Maintain separation between layers (app, services, repositories, domains)

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Check if the issue is already fixed in the latest version
3. Gather relevant information (OS, Go version, error messages)

### Issue Template

Use the provided issue templates:

- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Documentation Issue
- Question

## üöÄ Feature Development

### Before Starting

1. Check if a similar feature is already requested
2. Discuss major features in an issue first
3. Consider the impact on existing functionality
4. Think about backward compatibility

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Small**: Implement the core functionality first
2. **Add Tests**: Write tests as you develop
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep README and code comments up to date
4. **Consider UX**: Think about how users will interact with your feature
5. **Performance**: Consider the performance impact of your changes

## ÔøΩÔøΩ UI/UX Guidelines

### Terminal Interface

- Keep the interface clean and intuitive
- Use consistent keyboard shortcuts
- Provide helpful feedback to users
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Ensure the interface works in different terminal sizes

### Styling

- Use the existing style system in `app/styles/`
- Maintain consistency with the current design
- Consider accessibility (color contrast, etc.)
- Test in different terminal themes
